## Executive Summary

<span>

**Referring to the official article of the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (Kominfo),** from 2018 to the end of 2023, Kominfo handled **12,547 cases of hoax issues** with various themes. The KIC survey in 2020 stated that almost **60% of Indonesians were exposed to hoaxes** when accessing the internet. The spread of hoaxes in Indonesia creates a variety of consequences that cannot be underestimated. It starts from the instability of the economic and political climate, unrest and polarization of society, information doubts in every scientific field, and so on. So we formulated a solution as an application that combines pre-existing solutions, namely “*Factha*”.
